        Loyaltty utilizes various valid data transfer mechanisms for personal
        information at its sole discretion in accordance with applicable data
        protection and privacy laws. We will continue to monitor and assess the
        appropriateness of other valid data transfer mechanisms as they become
        available. Pursuant to Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code,
        residents of California have the right to request, once a year, if we
        have shared their personal information with other companies for those
        companies’ direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year.
        To request a copy of the information disclosure provided by Loyaltty,
        please contact us at info@Loyaltty.com or the address stated above.

        If you are a California resident under the age of 18, and a registered
        user of any site where this policy is posted, California Business and
        Professions Code Section 22581 permits you to request and obtain removal
        of content or information you have publicly posted. To make such a
        request, please send an email with a detailed description of the
        specific content or information to info@Loyaltty.com. Please be aware
        that such a request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of
        the content or information you have posted and that there may be
        circumstances in which the law does not require or allow removal even if
        requested.

        Loyaltty may offer discounts, rewards and other offers and benefits to
        you if you sign up to email and SMS promotional campaigns or other
        programs. When you sign up for one of these programs, we typically ask
        you to provide your name and contact information (such as email address
        and/or telephone number). Because our programs involve the collection of
        personal information as well as the offering of various benefits, they
        might be interpreted as providing a “financial incentive” under
        California law. To the extent that we derive value from the collection
        of your personal information, that value is directly related to the
        value to us of the opportunity to promote products and services to you
        as well as the value of the benefits that you obtain. You may withdraw
        from participating in a program at any time by contacting us using the
        designated method described in the terms and conditions that apply to
        the program, or by contacting us at info@Loyaltty.com.
